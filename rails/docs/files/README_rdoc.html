            <h1>Sunspot::Rails</h1>
            <p>
            Sunspot::Rails is a Rails plugin that provides drop-in integration of the
            <a href="http://outoftime.github.com/sunspot">Sunspot</a> Solr search
            library with Rails. It provides the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Configure Sunspot using config/sunspot.yml
            
            </li>
            <li>Extend ActiveRecord for easy index configuration, search, and indexing
            
            </li>
            <li>Automatically index ActiveRecord objects when they are saved, and remove
            them from the index when they are destroyed (can be disabled)
            
            </li>
            <li>Automatically commit Solr changes at the end of each request (can be
            disabled)
            
            </li>
            <li>Provide utility methods to find and fix orphaned documents and rebuild the
            Solr index for a given class
            
            </li>
            <li>Provide rake tasks for starting and stopping the development Solr instance,
            using the configuration in sunspot.yml
            
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Sunspot::Rails has been tested with Rails versions 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3
            </p>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>
            For recent versions of Rails, In your project&#8217;s
            <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>, add the following gem dependencies:
            </p>
            <pre>config.gem 'sunspot', :lib =&gt; 'sunspot'&#x000A;config.gem 'sunspot_rails', :lib =&gt; 'sunspot/rails'</pre>
            <p>
            Install the gems with:
            </p>
            <pre>rake gems:install</pre>
            <p>
            If you are using an older version of Rails that doesn&#8217;t support
            plugins-as-gems, install the gems manually and install the plugin:
            </p>
            <pre>sudo gem install sunspot sunspot_rails --source=http://gems.github.com&#x000A;&#x000A;script/plugin install git://github.com/outoftime/sunspot_rails.git</pre>
            <p>
            Generate the file <tt>config/sunspot.yml</tt>:
            </p>
            <pre>script/generate sunspot</pre>
            <p>
            Rails doesn&#8217;t automatically load rake tasks from plugins installed as
            gems (<a
            href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/59">rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/59</a>).
            If you installed Sunspot::Rails as a gem, add the following line to your
            project&#8217;s Rakefile:
            </p>
            <pre>require 'sunspot/rails/tasks'</pre>
            <p>
            If you wish to make modifications to the Solr schema, you can create a
            custom Solr home in your project directory. In order to do so, create the
            directory <tt>RAILS_ROOT/solr/conf</tt>, and copy in the contents of the
            Solr gem&#8217;s <tt>solr/solr/conf</tt> directory. If the files are in the
            right place, Sunspot::Rails will detect them and tell Solr to use your
            local configurations. Use caution when modifying <tt>schema.xml</tt> -
            Sunspot relies on the field naming scheme in the packaged schema file.
            </p>
            <p>
            To start up a Solr instance, issue the following:
            </p>
            <pre>rake sunspot:solr:start</pre>
            <p>
            Note that using the built-in Solr instance packaged with Sunspot is great
            for development, but is not recommended for production. See the Sunspot
            documentation for more information.
            </p>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>
            In order for an ActiveRecord model to be indexable and searchable, it must
            be configured for search. For example:
            </p>
            <pre>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  searchable do&#x000A;    text :title, :body&#x000A;    integer :blog_id&#x000A;    time :updated_at&#x000A;    string :sort_title do&#x000A;      title.downcase.sub(/^(an?|the) /, '')&#x000A;    end&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            See the documentation for Sunspot.setup for full details on what can go in
            the configuration block.
            </p>
            <h3>Indexing</h3>
            <p>
            By default, models are indexed whenever they are saved, and removed from
            the index whenever they are destroyed. This behavior can be disabled:
            </p>
            <pre>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base&#x000A;  searchable :auto_index =&gt; false, :auto_remove =&gt; false do&#x000A;    # setup...&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Note that <b>using the <tt>:auto_remove</tt> option is not recommended
            </b>, as destroying an object without removing it from the index will
            create an orphaned document in the index, which is a Bad Thing. Turning off
            <tt>:auto_index</tt> is perfectly safe if you prefer to manage indexing
            manually (perhaps using a background job).
            </p>
            <p>
            If you have disabled lifecycle indexing hooks, you can invoke indexing
            operations directly on your model:
            </p>
            <pre>post = Post.create&#x000A;post.index&#x000A;post.remove_from_index</pre>
            <h3>Committing</h3>
            <p>
            When data is changed in Solr, it is initially stored in memory and not made
            available to the currently running searcher instance. Issuing a
            <tt>commit</tt> to Solr will cause it to write the changes to disk, and
            instantiate a new searcher instance. This operation is fairly expensive, so
            rather than issuing a commit every time a document is added or removed,
            Sunspot::Rails issues a commit at the end of any request where data has
            been added to or removed from Solr. If you need to immediately issue a
            commit, bang!-versions of the methods are available:
            </p>
            <pre>post = Post.create&#x000A;post.index!&#x000A;# this is the same as...&#x000A;post.index&#x000A;Sunspot.commit</pre>
            <p>
            When writing tests outside of the context of a controller request, you will
            want to use one of these two approaches.
            </p>
            <h3>Searching</h3>
            <p>
            Do it like this:
            </p>
            <pre>Post.search do&#x000A;  with :blog_id, 1&#x000A;  with(:updated_at).greater_than(Time.now - 2.weeks)&#x000A;  order :sort_title, :asc&#x000A;  paginate :page =&gt; 1, :per_page =&gt; 15&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            See the documentation for <tt>Sunspot.search</tt> for all the options
            available in the search block, and the information available in the result
            block.
            </p>
            <h3>Searching for IDs</h3>
            <p>
            In some situations, you may want to get the IDs for models returned by a
            search without actually loading the models out of the database. For that,
            you can call <tt>search_ids</tt>, using the same block format as search.
            This will return an array of IDs.
            </p>
            <h3>Searching for multiple types</h3>
            <p>
            Sunspot is entirely agnostic about whether searches are for one or more
            types; the only restriction is that columns used for restriction, ordering,
            etc. are defined in the same way for all types being searched.
            Sunspot::Rails does not provide any additional support for this, since
            there is not anything useful to be added, so just use the interface
            provided by Sunspot:
            </p>
            <pre>Sunspot.search(Post, Comment) do&#x000A;  with :blog_id, 1&#x000A;  order :created_at, :asc&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Be sure to check out the Sunspot documentation for all the details.
            </p>
            <h3>Adding search functionality in mixins</h3>
            <p>
            Sunspot does not require that search setup for a given class happen all in
            one place; it is perfectly acceptable to call the <tt>Sunspot.setup</tt>
            method more than once. This capability is particularly useful for adding
            search functionality in mixins. For instance, if you have a
            <tt>Ratable</tt> module, you may wish to add additional search fields for
            searchable classes that mix in that module. For example:
            </p>
            <pre>module Ratable&#x000A;  def self.included(base)&#x000A;    if base.searchable?&#x000A;      base.searchable do&#x000A;        float :average_rating do&#x000A;          ratings.average(:value)&#x000A;        end&#x000A;      end&#x000A;    end&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            Note the use of <tt>base.searchable?</tt> - this ensures that only classes
            that already have search enabled will have the additional configuration
            added. The above pattern requires that the class be declared searchable
            before the module is mixed in; other patterns (such as passing a
            :searchable option to an acts_as_-style declaration) may be more flexible.
            </p>
            <h3>Utility methods</h3>
            <p>
            If you need to completely reindex all of the instances of a given model
            class, you can issue:
            </p>
            <pre>Post.reindex</pre>
            <p>
            If for some reason models get deleted from the database, but not from the
            index, they will become index orphans - not a good situation. To get IDs
            that exist in the index but not the database, you can use the
            <tt>index_orphans</tt> method; to remove those documents from the index,
            use <tt>clean_index_orphans</tt>. Note that neither of these operations
            should be needed if Sunspot and Sunspot::Rails are used as intended.
            </p>
            <h2>Testing Solr integration using RSpec</h2>
            <p>
            To disable the sunspot-solr integration for your active record models,
            require the file `sunspot/rails/spec_helper`
            </p>
            <p>
            Then, in your spec, use the disconnect_sunspot method:
            </p>
            <pre>require 'sunspot/rails/spec_helper'&#x000A;&#x000A;describe Post do&#x000A;  disconnect_sunspot&#x000A;&#x000A;  it 'should have some behavior'&#x000A;    # ...&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end</pre>
            <p>
            In all of the examples in this group, all Sunspot calls will be stubbed
            out. The Sunspot#search method will return a stub search object that mimics
            a search with no results.
            </p>
            <h2>Further Reading</h2>
            <p>
            Reading the <a href="http://outoftime.github.com/sunspot/docs">Sunspot
            documentation</a> is highly recommended. Sunspot::Rails exists to wrap
            Sunspot with a Rails-friendly API, but almost all of the functionality you
            use in Sunspot::Rails is implemented in Sunspot.

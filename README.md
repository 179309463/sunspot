# Sunspot

[![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/sunspot/sunspot.png)](http://travis-ci.org/sunspot/sunspot)

Sunspot is a Ruby library for expressive, powerful interaction with the Solr
search engine. Sunspot is built on top of the RSolr library, which
provides a low-level interface for Solr interaction; Sunspot provides a simple,
intuitive, expressive DSL backed by powerful features for indexing objects and
searching for them.

Sunspot is designed to be easily plugged in to any ORM, or even non-database-backed
objects such as the filesystem.

## Quickstart with Rails 3

Add to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sunspot_rails'
gem 'sunspot_solr' # optional pre-packaged Solr distribution for use in development
```

Bundle it!

```bash
bundle install
```

Generate a default configuration file:

```bash
rails generate sunspot_rails:install
```

If `sunspot_solr` was installed, start the packaged Solr distribution
with:

```bash
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start # or sunspot:solr:run to start in foreground
```

## Setting Up Objects

Add a `searchable` block to the objects you wish to index.

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchable do
    text :title, :body
    text :comments do
      comments.map { |comment| comment.body }
    end

    boolean :featured
    integer :blog_id
    integer :author_id
    integer :category_ids, :multiple => true
    double  :average_rating
    time    :published_at
    time    :expired_at

    string  :sort_title do
      title.downcase.gsub(/^(an?|the)/, '')
    end
  end
end
```

`text` fields will be full-text searchable. Other fields (e.g.,
`integer` and `string`) can be used to scope queries.

## Searching Objects

```ruby
Post.search do
  fulltext 'best pizza'

  with :blog_id, 1
  with(:published_at).less_than Time.now
  order_by :published_at, :desc
  paginate :page => 2, :per_page => 15
  facet :category_ids, :author_id
end
```

## Search In Depth

Given an object `Post` setup in earlier steps ...

### Full Text

```ruby
# All posts with a `text` field (:title, :body, or :comments) containing 'pizza'
Post.search { fulltext 'pizza' }

# Posts with pizza, scored higher if pizza appears in the title
Post.search do
  fulltext 'pizza' do
    boost_fields :title => 2.0
  end
end

# Posts with pizza, scored higher if featured
Post.search do
  fulltext 'pizza' do
    boost(2.0) { with(:featured, true) }
  end
end

# Posts with pizza *only* in the title
Post.search do
  fulltext 'pizza' do
    fields(:title)
  end
end

# Posts with pizza in the title (boosted) or in the body (not boosted)
Post.search do
  fulltext 'pizza' do
    fields(:body, :title => 2.0)
  end
end
```

### Scoping (Scalar Fields)

Fields not defined as `text` (e.g., `integer`, `boolean`, `time`,
etc...) can be used to scope (restrict) queries.

#### Positive Restrictions

```ruby
# Posts with a blog_id of 1
Post.search do
  with(:blog_id, 1)
end

# Posts with an average rating between 3.0 and 5.0
Post.search do
  with(:average_rating, 3.0..5.0)
end

# Posts with a category of 1, 3, or 5
Post.search do
  with(:category_ids, [1, 3, 5])
end

# Posts published since a week ago
Post.search do
  with(:published_at).greater_than(1.week.ago)
end
```

#### Negative Restrictions

```ruby
# Posts not in category 1 or 3
Post.search do
  without(:category_ids, [1, 3])
end

# All examples in "positive" also work negated using `without`
```

#### Disjunctions and Conjunctions

```ruby
# Posts that do not have an expired time or have not yet expired
Post.search do
  any_of do
    with(:expired_at).greater_than(Time.now)
    with(:expired_at, nil)
  end
end
```

```ruby
# Posts with blog_id 1 and author_id 2
Post.search do
  all_of do
    with(:blog_id, 1)
    with(:author_id, 2)
  end
end
```

Disjunctions and conjunctions may be nested

```ruby
Post.search do
  any_of do
    with(:blog_id, 1)
    all_of do
      with(:blog_id, 2)
      with(:category_ids, 3)
    end
  end
end
```

## Reindexing Objects

If you are using Rails, objects are automatically indexed to Solr as a
part of the `save` callbacks.

If you make a change to the object's "schema" (code in the `searchable` block),
you must reindex all objects so the changes are reflected in Solr:

```bash
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex

# or, to be specific to a certain model with a certain batch size:
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex[500,Post] # some shells will require escaping [ with \[ and ] with \]
```
